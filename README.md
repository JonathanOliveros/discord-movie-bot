# discord-movie-bot
## Summary
A Discord bot that has 3 functions:
- (!categories) lists genres available in list to choose from
- (!top) shows top 5 movies within that genre
- (!movie) returns details of specified movie
## What I Learned
- How to use the BeautifulSoup module to web scrape so that I can get top movies off of specified website
- How to call a website API which returns data in JSON format
- Formatting JSON for better readability
